# About The Website

I Started this project assuming I would get an API that will provide me essential data for all student in every school in Ethiopia. then I changed my idea and end up making it a site to reveal results for the SSLE only for my school students.

## Features of the App

What makes this site diffrent from the Oficial SSLE site ?
In this site you can see your result for the SSL 2020 Exam as the Oficial site but not only that you can also: -

1, See your Rank from your school.

2, Search your result using only name if you forget your Reg No.

3, See the top 10 students who scored highest.

4, See students who scored the same results as you.

5, And a bunch of other cool features.
